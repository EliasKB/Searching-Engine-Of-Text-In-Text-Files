# Searching Engine Of Text In Text Files
## We assume that frequency of input word in a text file in not taken into account. 
### Suppose you have some textfiles in you folder and want to search whether a specific word or a sentence exist in the files or not. 
This engine searcher will help you to find how many percent of the input words exists in each file. 
As input (or the words you want to search), you use the scanner function and enter the words by keyboard. 
As an output of the model you get a list of filenames (in your folder) in ascending order and corresponding procent of the input words that exist in each file. 
The process continues and you can type new words and sentencs and it can be ended by entering the word "quiz". 
#### Have you any question, dont mind and please ask!
